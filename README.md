# Map of the Realm: Know Thy Data

Welcome to the first real-world project in the **Welcome to the Data Kingdom** series!  
This notebook explores the fundamentals of working with different data types and structures in Python and Pandas, all wrapped in a whimsical medieval theme.

Great for beginners learning to inspect, load, and clean data in Python!

## What's Inside

- Native Python data types: strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets
- Structured file formats: CSV, JSON, and Excel
- How to load and preview data using Pandas
- How to clean messy data for analysis
- Hands-on coding challenges to reinforce learning
- A touch of magic and medieval fun throughout

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebooks

## Sections Overview

### Core Python Containers
Learn how native Python data types act as the "containers" for all data:
- `str`, `int`, `float`
- `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`

### Pandas: The Royal Archivist
Understand what `Series` and `DataFrames` are, and how to create and use them.

### Meet the Scrolls (Data Files)
Get familiar with:
- CSV: the commoner's scroll
- JSON: the magical nested scroll
- Excel: the royal ledger

### Inspecting Data
Use methods like `.head()`, `.info()`, `.shape`, `.columns`, and `.describe()` to peek into your scrolls before analysis.

### Cleaning the Royal Records
Tidy up messy data using Pandas:
- Renaming columns
- Handling missing values
- Converting data types
- Stripping extra spaces

### The Royal Census Report
Run summary statistics and value counts to get a high-level view of your data.

## Project Goals
By the end of this notebook, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Identify Pythonâ€™s built-in data types
- Understand the structure of Pandas Series and DataFrames
- Load and preview CSV, JSON, and Excel files
- Inspect and clean basic datasets
- Communicate your findings with summary stats
