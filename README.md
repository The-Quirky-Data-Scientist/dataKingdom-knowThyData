# Project Title

## Overview
Brief description of what this project is, what it's about, and what a viewer or learner will gain from it.

This project was created as part of my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@thequirkydatascientist), where I walk through real-world data projects in a fun and beginner-friendly way.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw, interim, and processed data files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter/Colab notebooks for each step of the workflow
- `outputs/`: Figures, charts, and reports from the analysis
- `scripts/`: (Optional) Python modules for cleaning or processing

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder  
3. Follow along with the video walkthrough  
4. Try modifying the project or adding your own data!
