# Map of the Realm: Know Thy Data

This project explores the fundamentals of working with different data types and structuresâ€”both imported and integratedâ€”through a whimsical lens inspired by the Kingdom of Data. It's a companion project to the YouTube video *"Map of the Realm: Know Thy Data,"* part of the **Welcome to the Data Kingdom** series.

## What's Inside

- Example datasets showcasing various data types within Python and common structured formats
- Messy and clean data for practicing identification and transformation
- A walkthrough notebook to explore and classify types of data found in the realm
- Step-by-step guidance on importing and lightly cleaning data, with explanations designed for beginners

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw, interim, and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for exploration and data type classification
- `outputs/`: Saved figures, reports, and supporting files
- `scripts/`: Optional Python modules used in preprocessing or automation

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `notebooks/01-exploration.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab
3. Follow along with the walkthrough or try your own classification and cleanup
4. View saved charts and reports in the `outputs/` folder

## Goals

- Reinforce core data type concepts through hands-on exploration
- Help beginners recognize and navigate a variety of real-world data structures
